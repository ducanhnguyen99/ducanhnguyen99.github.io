- name: Reinforcement Learning to create a competitive Catan bot
  descr: >
    I aim to develop a reinforcement learning agent capable of competing against human players in the board game Catan. 
    By leveraging platforms like colonist.io — which provide extensive recordings of past games — 
    and modeling Catan as a well-defined environment with explicit rules, the agent can be trained on realistic scenarios.
    This project seeks to enhance the competitive Catan scene and uncover novel strategies beyond the known OWS, Road, Hybrid, 
    or side-by-side setups.

- name: Scraping supermarket products with dietary and allergic restrictions for personal use
  descr: >
    Many people in my community face dietary restrictions - such as needing gluten-free options due to intolerance or celiac disease, 
    or avoiding onion and garlic for religious reasons. While some supermarket products are labeled accordingly, 
    many regular items are overlooked because manually scanning ingredient lists is tedious. 
    By automatically scraping product information from supermarket websites, 
    this project aims to create a comprehensive list of eligible products based on their ingredients. 
    This resource will empower individuals with dietary restrictions to make informed choices and enjoy a wider range of products.

- name: Building a RAG to aid learning rules of new board games
  descr: >
    Recently, while trying to learn a new board game, I struggled to fully understand its rules from the paper guide and 
    accompanying video. Even after reviewing all the provided materials, unanswered questions remained. 
    This experience highlighted the potential of a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based chatbot for learning new board games. 
    By integrating expert knowledge and FAQs, such a chatbot could be accessed with a simple QR scan on the board game's packaging. 
    Players could then ask any question about the game and receive immediate, accurate answers, greatly enhancing their understanding 
    and learning experience.

- name: Building a RAG for restaurant recommendations and advice on food choice
  descr: >
    Deciding on a restaurant with your partner or friends is challenging enough, especially when trying to accommodate everyone's 
    preferences. For example, some may want burgers while others crave fried sushi, and you hope to order both from a single restaurant.
    A RAG-based chatbot can analyze these varied preferences and recommend one place—such as via Lieferando—that satisfies all wishes. 
    Currently, Lieferando categorizes by individual cuisines rather than specific dishes. By training the model with extensive 
    knowledge about various dishes, users could input preferences like tofu, vegetarian options, low-calorie, or lactose-free meals to 
    receive tailored restaurant recommendations.
